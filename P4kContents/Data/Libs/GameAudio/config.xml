This will cause all 5 platforms to be written out for every ATLPreloadRequest.
Having this file ensures only the platforms found in the ATLPlatforms elements in the ATLConfig xml files will be added. eg:

   <ATLPlatforms>
    <Platform atl_name="pc" atl_config_group_name="default"/>
   </ATLPlatforms>
